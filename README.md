# Data Visualization App using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)

This project is an exercise in my study of NextJS and ReactJS.<br>

## Objective

The main objective is to use GoogleDoc as data source for visualization.<br>
I will be using [react-google-charts](https://react-google-charts.com/) module to render the charts/tables.

## Description

**The data is just dummy.**<br><br>
The data view is based on COVID-19 outbreak trackers.<br>
Currently, there are three charts:<br>

* Stacked-Bar chart that shows PUI daily total.

* Line chart that tracks the number of cases.

* Table chart that list the PUI data for different regions.
